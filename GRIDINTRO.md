### THE GRID ###


#### What is the grid? Bulletpoints for lazy readers ####

* A collective of individuals
* The intention to create a social sculpture
* A heterogeneous mix of interests, opinions, initiatives and topics
* A decentral and virtual space for collaboraiton
* A non-hierarchically organized network
* An environment to discuss future challenges and utopical ideas
* A concept in evolution, which is open for multi-disciplinary perspectives


### AN INTRODUCTION TO THE GRID ###

The GRID got ramped-up in May 2018.

An early ambition for a concept like the GRID was to form a decentralized organized network of individuals to make things happen. Individuals of any color, sex, religion or social background ..., but compatible enough to form a platform for new chances and higher impact.

Chances for the creation of cultural assets as well as chances for bringing together the right people at the right time to form new initiatives.

As articulated in the film Fight Club ... 

	'You are not your job.
	You are not how much money you have in the bank.
	You are not the shoes you wear.
	You are not the contents of your wallet.'

... the fundamental motivation behind the GRID is to start an experiment liberating individual and group potential. A potential, not driven by money, not regulated by power, but intrisic motivation. A potential which could be focused furthermore for doing good stuff with higher positive impact for the individual being and collective journey.

The GRID'S ambition level on a more abstract level is to form a workforce dedicated to the challenge of thinking in better versions of the world. 

And we think, that it is on each of us to improve many aspects of our world:

####*//side-intro*####

Let's say ... the world is not totally fucked-up, but ...

... many of the latest global political trends, caused by reactionary, populist or even autocratic misconception and degration of reality require immediate and long-term action. As humanity we have to become better version of ourselves, not the contrary. We are not consumers, not slaves, not ressources for anyone else - we are the difference when it comes to future. 

Our world is n-dimensionally connected and physically limited when it comes earths ressources we feast on or the air we breathe. Only the increase of collective wisdom, foresight, empathie and collaboration will save us. We need to increase the civilisatoric evolutionspeed. We need a vision of ourselve. Not anything like the law of the jungle, more walls, suppression, protectionism or any other prehistoric behavioural pattern. We have to invest into a global sociocultural progress, we do not must go back into trees or holes, throwing stones at each other. 

More than that, humanity has to face many major challenges, for example caused by the effect of climate change and our global impact connected the immoral exploitation of natural ressources (including other species). We must grow up and find ways to re-think what we do and how we do it. Not corporates will save, not any of our gods, and for sure - none of the reactionary leaders. It's not about democracy here - it is about future models and concepts of how we could live, of what we want to achieve, of how we can define and reach a  healthy global prosperity level open for all, equality of chances and rights, global do's and dont's and balanced behaviour with our surrounding environment and other life.

Even more than that, we have to answer so many detailed ethical, pragmatical or existentially important questions within a highly complex world. We haven't overcome fundamental problems, like warfare, discrimination and other hygiene factors compared to what it takes looking into future. We are absolutely not sure what robotics, AI, automation, nano- and biotech and other disruptive technologies will finally mean to our shared existence. Economy at this stage is also just forming new empires, not a better world, if we think about the increased gap between super-rich and poor individuals.

There were a lot of good evolutions going on during the last thousands of years. But what needs attention is the shit. So the lines before shall not express cultural pessimism at its best - on the contrary, it is articulated out of the ambition and strong belief that we can achieve a lot of more crazy things if we only try it and do not lay back. Plus, it is not the time to lay back, since some of the achievements for which many souls fought over centuries can get lost again. We have to pay attention to the big picture and the detail. That is the mission without alternative.

The GRID is and will not be an answer to the big question of this centruy. 

But the GRID collective is trying to identify and discuss valid questions on a high and low level. 

It is just meant as a small brick on the road which needs to be paved, not the road itself. 

The GRID is intended to become a social plastic, a think tank, a decentrally organized collaboration collective, a room for reflection, failure, analysis and debate.

*Nothing more.*

*And nothing less.*

**This all starts with people.** 

People, who show buy-in and are willing to share lots and lots of hours of discussion, exchanging hypotheses and chatting.
People who try and fail - endless times perhaps. 


The GRID is not a promise, it's an unproven experiment.

The GRID is not a political party, it's just a network of people.

The GRID is not a secret organization, it's an environment of collaborators.

The GRID is not a commercial project, it's a social sculpture.

The GRID has no investors, it is built on invidual efforts.

#### The GRID shall become a *mashup of the following* ####

* A decentralized environment allowing people to connect and collaborate
* A laboratory and think-tank which works against an agenda
* A place for researching on new ways of participation, a space for constructive debate
* A clear statement against reactionary, populist, fashist or racist tendencies and other forms of fatal misconception
* A network of individuals sharing the general belief that lifetime could and should be spent in a better way (and abilities could utilized and developed more purposeful) than in monolithic job-constructs
* A non-commercial collective supporting the formation of commercial spin-offs (comment: monetarization of worl & ideas is not bad, if a resulting organization is of social value) as well as other initiatives (like art projects)
* An interdisciplinary room where art, technology, critical thinking and research are not antagonists at all, but domains of multidisciplinary stimulation
* A concept in which innovation, invention and ideation is understood as an important cultural asset & methodology to overcome problems which correlate to a certain state of mind or cognition - nothing more (!)
* A place where the creation of cultural or technological assets is reflected as natural human behaviour which needs support
* A call for utopical concepts and promising ideas related to the human future (as individual being and the human society)
* An assembly of tools, skills, experiences, methodologies and approaches to make use of
* A vehicle to create an agenda of relevant future questions (GRID AGENDA), which are main themes of action like an umbrella - this implicitly questions perhaps the agenda setting
* A foundation for interaction based on values, not profit
* A framework (GRID MECHANICS) which can be freely replicated, hacked, adopted for other purposes (that's why we share it)
* An self-measuring organism - the GRID has to measure itself on its output / impact to survive furthermore > too low output will lead to change and new increments of the GRID or its death
* Fun & passion as it is a social endeavor - playfulness and the inclusion of fun is important
* Experimental space for functional and non-functional ideas
* A place for you to make broader use of your skills and individuality through contribution
* A place for you to find the right people for the realization of your idea
* A room for learning and exchange of expertise
* A room for sharing knowledge and individual insights
* A mental model which purely is driven and sustained by intrinsic motivation
* A platform for questioning the status quo

[...]



#### The *GRID is NOT* ####

* A place for trolling, bullying or any kind of discrimination
* A place for racists, fashists, homophobics or other malware
* A company or any other form of profit oriented undertaking
* A place for one-directional consume of benefits / misuse of other people skills (meaning: if one wants to get 100% out, one needs to bring 200% in)
* A room, disconnected from existing laws and restrictions
* Written in stone related to its conception, processes or methodology, as it is meant to be a learning, flexible and adaptive organism
* Meant to be an answer (instead it is meant to be a place for better questions)
* A special interest group
* For granted - forming, maintaining, sustaining the GRID and it's evolution is hard work with uncertain outcome. There is the permanent risk of ultimate failure - and that is ok.
* A binding show! Once you became GRIDSTER, there is no binding form or frequence of contribution. But obviously the chances are low to create high impact without participation or contribution. But it's not anyhow connected to binding mechanisms.
