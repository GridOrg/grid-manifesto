# GRID MANIFESTO #


### AN INTRODUCTION TO THE GRID ###

The GRID got ramped-up in May 2018.

The early ambition was to trigger the existence of a decentralized network of individuals. Individuals of any color, sex, religion or social background ..., but compatible enough to form a platform for new chances.

Chances for the creation of cultural assets as well as chances for bringing together the right people at the right time.
As articulated in the film Fight Club ... 

	'You are not your job.
	You are not how much money you have in the bank.
	You are not the shoes you wear.
	You are not the contents of your wallet.'

... the fundamental motivation behind the GRID is to start an experiment liberating individual and group potential. A potential, not driven by money, not regulated by power, but intrisic motivation.

The GRID'S ambition level shall be to become a workforce for thinking in better versions of the world. And we have to improve our world furthermore:

The world is not totally fucked-up, but ...
... many of the latest political trends, caused by reactionary, populist or even autocratic misconception and degrtion of reality require immediate and long-term action. As humanity we have to become better version of ourselves, not the contrary. Thrown into existence, we are not consumers, not slaves, not workers for anyone else - we are same. Our world is connected and physically limited when it comes earths ressources we feast on. Only the increase of collective wisdom, foresight, empathie and collaboration will save us. Not anything like the law of the jungle, walls, suppression, protectionism or any other medieval power behaviour. We have to invest into a global sociocultural evolution, not into climbing back into trees throwing stones at each other. 

More than that, humanity has to face many major challenges, for example caused by climate change and our global impact connected the immoral exploitation of natural ressources (including other species). We must grow up. 

Even more than that, we have to answer so many ethical, pragmatical or existentially questions in an increasingly complex world. We haven't overcome inequality, wars, discrimination and many other roadblocks on our way to future. We are not sure what robotics, AI, automation, nano- and biotech and other disruptive technologies will finally mean to or within our existence. 

The GRID is not an answer to the big question of this centruy. But it tries to identify valid questions. It is just meant as a small brick on the road which needs to be paved, not the road itself. 
The GRID is intended to perhaps become a social plastic, a think tank, a decentral collaboration collective, a room for reflection, analysis and debate.

Nothing more.
And nothing less!

This all starts with people. People, who show buy-in and are willing to share lots and lots of hours of discussion, exchanging hypotheses and chatting.
People who try and fail - endless times perhaps. 


The GRID is not a promise, it's an unproven experiment.


____________

The GRID shall be a *mashup of the following*:

* A decentralized environment allowing people to connect and collaborate
* A laboratory and think-tank
* A place where to create ways of participation
* A statement against reactionary tendencies or other forms of fatal misconception
* A network of individuals sharing the general belief that lifetime could be better spent (and abilities could utilized and developed more purposeful) than in monolithic job-constructs
* A non-commercial collective which supports the formation of commercial spin-offs (comment: monetarization of own work and ideas is not bad, if a resulting organization is willing to commit to moral and sustainability standards) as well as other initiatives (like cultural or social projects)
* A interdisciplinary room where art, technology, critical thinking or research are not antagonists at all, but domains of stimulation for each other
* A concept in which innovation, invention and ideation is understood as a cultural methodology to overcome problems - nothing more (!)
* A place where the creation of cultural, technological or commercial assets is reflected as natural human behaviour
* A call for utopical concepts and promising ideas related to the human future
* An assembly of tools, skills, experiences, methodologies and approaches to make use of
* A vehicle to create an agenda of relevant future questions (GRID AGENDA), which are main themes of action like an umbrella
* A foundation of values
* A conceptual framework (GRID MECHANICS) which can be replicated, hacked, adopted for other purposes
* An impact creating organism - the GRID has to measure itself on its output to survive
* Fun & passion
* Experimental space
* Social sculpture
* A place to use your skills and individuality
* A place where it is possible to find the right people for the realization of your idea
* A room for learing and exchange
* A mental model which only is driven and sustained by intrinsic motivation.

[...]

The *GRID is not*:

* A place for trolling, bullying or any kind of discrimination
* A place for racists, reactionsts, populists, fashists, homophobics
* A company or any other form of commercial undertaking
* A place for one-directional consume of benefits / misuse of people skills (meaning: if one wants to get something out, one needs to bring something in)
* Disconnected from existing laws and restrictions
* Written in stone related to its conception, processes or methodology, as it is meant to be a learning, flexible and adaptive organism
* Meant to be an answer (instead it is meant to be a place for better questions)
* A special interest group, because of its interdisciplinary approach
* For granted - forming, maintaining, sustaining the GRID and it's evolution is hard work. There is always the risk for ultimate failure - and that is ok.
* A binding show! Once you became GRIDSTER, there is no binding form or frequence of contribution. But obviously the chances are low to create high impact without participation or contribution. But it's not anyhow connected to binding mechanisms.

### THE GRID VALUES ###

As the initial GRID CORE we share or accumulate certain values.
To identify a few of them let's list some thoughts ...

* We deeply believe in the value of equality and the right on individual progress
* Mankind has to research on ways to reduce its negative impact on surrounding lifeforms, for example caused by un-/intentionally created pain, suffering, ignorance and discrimination.
* Mankind has to find ways to integrate individuality, the human collective to overcome the threat of extinction.
* The human being is a transitional species, trapped in-between archaic past and science-fiction. To accept ourselves and transform us towards positive potential, we need to discuss utopical ideas more importantly than framing conditions.

Behaviour and attitudes we welcome:

* critical challenging thinking
* openness for exchange of thoughts
* creativity and experimentation
* the value of non-functionality
* collaboration and constuctivity
* individuality and collective repsonsibility
* utopical conception of 'what can be'
* sharing among others and contribution
* curiosity and the willingness to learn


### GRID FRAMEWORK ###

The GRID FRAMEWORK explains ideas and concepts for running the GRID.

Besides infos about the GRID or the GRID MANIFSTO itself this framework will be published as food for thoughts.
We invite everyone and every social constellation to adapt, hack, modify or replicate certain concepts or the full framework for own purposes. The GRID collective will for shure see evolution, so that we will change underlying approaches or practices. Important changes will be updated. 

If you want to share your findings, ideas or feedback, please reach out to gridcore@into-the-grid.org
