# GRID MANIFESTO #

### What is the grid? For lazy readers - SUPER SHORT NUTSHELL THINGY ###

* A collective of individuals
* A social sculpture
* A heterogene mix of interests and topics
* A decentral and open construct, only restricted by its values
* A collaboration environment to work on stuff which brings us all forward
* A concept in feasibility test


### AN INTRODUCTION TO THE GRID ###

The GRID got ramped-up in May 2018.

An early ambition for a concept like the GRID was to form a decentralized organized network of individuals to make things happen. Individuals of any color, sex, religion or social background ..., but compatible enough to form a platform for new chances and higher impact.

Chances for the creation of cultural assets as well as chances for bringing together the right people at the right time to form new initiatives.

As articulated in the film Fight Club ... 

	'You are not your job.
	You are not how much money you have in the bank.
	You are not the shoes you wear.
	You are not the contents of your wallet.'

... the fundamental motivation behind the GRID is to start an experiment liberating individual and group potential. A potential, not driven by money, not regulated by power, but intrisic motivation. A potential which could be focused furthermore for doing good stuff with higher positive impact for the individual being and collective journey.

The GRID'S ambition level on a more abstract level is to form a workforce dedicated to the challenge of thinking in better versions of the world. 

And we think, that it is on each of us to improve many aspects of our world:

####*//side-intro*####

Let's say ... the world is not totally fucked-up, but ...

... many of the latest global political trends, caused by reactionary, populist or even autocratic misconception and degration of reality require immediate and long-term action. As humanity we have to become better version of ourselves, not the contrary. We are not consumers, not slaves, not ressources for anyone else - we are the difference when it comes to future. 

Our world is n-dimensionally connected and physically limited when it comes earths ressources we feast on or the air we breathe. Only the increase of collective wisdom, foresight, empathie and collaboration will save us. We need to increase the civilisatoric evolutionspeed. We need a vision of ourselve. Not anything like the law of the jungle, more walls, suppression, protectionism or any other prehistoric behavioural pattern. We have to invest into a global sociocultural progress, we do not must go back into trees or holes, throwing stones at each other. 

More than that, humanity has to face many major challenges, for example caused by the effect of climate change and our global impact connected the immoral exploitation of natural ressources (including other species). We must grow up and find ways to re-think what we do and how we do it. Not corporates will save, not any of our gods, and for sure - none of the reactionary leaders. It's not about democracy here - it is about future models and concepts of how we could live, of what we want to achieve, of how we can define and reach a  healthy global prosperity level open for all, equality of chances and rights, global do's and dont's and balanced behaviour with our surrounding environment and other life.

Even more than that, we have to answer so many detailed ethical, pragmatical or existentially important questions within a highly complex world. We haven't overcome fundamental problems, like warfare, discrimination and other hygiene factors compared to what it takes looking into future. We are absolutely not sure what robotics, AI, automation, nano- and biotech and other disruptive technologies will finally mean to our shared existence. Economy at this stage is also just forming new empires, not a better world, if we think about the increased gap between super-rich and poor individuals.

There were a lot of good evolutions going on during the last thousands of years. But what needs attention is the shit. So the lines before shall not express cultural pessimism at its best - on the contrary, it is articulated out of the ambition and strong belief that we can achieve a lot of more crazy things if we only try it and do not lay back. Plus, it is not the time to lay back, since some of the achievements for which many souls fought over centuries can get lost again. We have to pay attention to the big picture and the detail. That is the mission without alternative.

####*//side-intro end*####

The GRID is and will not be an answer to the big question of this centruy. 

(Promise!)

But it tries to identify valid questions on a high and low level. 

It is just meant as a small brick on the road which needs to be paved, not the road itself. The GRID is intended to perhaps become a social plastic, a think tank, a decentral collaboration collective, a room for reflection, analysis and debate.

*Nothing more.*

*And nothing less.*

**This all starts with people.** People, who show buy-in and are willing to share lots and lots of hours of discussion, exchanging hypotheses and chatting.
People who try and fail - endless times perhaps. 


The GRID is not a promise, it's an unproven experiment.

The GRID is not a political party, it's just people.

The GRID is not a secret organization, it's an environment of collaborators.

The GRID is not a commercial project, it's a social plastic.

The GRID has no investors, it is just there ...

#### What are some beliefs to get the picture ? ####


The mental model of the world has to shift into some big picture attitude.
Let's do a short experiment of thoughts... 

If you project the human species in a point in time contradicting the present status quo. What are possible thoughts in here?

It is not that spectacular to think humanity without nations.
It would not be extremely surprising that - in 1-2 thousands of years - we had to find ways to change our paradigms for energy production, for food production, for the search and mining and consumption of ressources, for the definition of work, for what a religion is, for technology we have to develop based on future challenges. 

What do you think?

What is a minimal viable reality in a thousand years?

To be not the ultimate looser in a thousand years, what would be the consequence projected back into our present reality?

Which parameters should be taken into the calculation here?

Some aspects are rather simple:

We will have problems with ressources sooner or later. If you extrapolate the growth rate of our species for a century (like a weather forecast let's say) and if you add the ressource consumption of today into this calculation, then you don't have to be a genius to come to the conclusion that there might be a problem one day. How do we normally act in such situations (use history books here)? Hmmm ... pretty uncool, right? Which alternative realities could be provoked then, if we change variables in the near future? Which variables do we put to discussions, which are not to discuss? Then what will result?

Some aspects are rather complicated:

Like the *Club of rome* had some errors in extrapolation, most people will have errors in extrapolation towards a bigger picture. Because bigger pictures never are free from intention, because you always miss the unpredictable variable, because we are only smart in reviews. That's perhaps our cognitive condition. But the bigger picture is not really about the accurate calculation, it is about the interpretation which adaption needs to be done, if this or that outcome shall be the preferred one. Compare this to the doomsday clock ...  [(check it out here)](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/) Most of us think, doomsday is rather uncool - let's not have it. That's why we measure 'somehow on a qualitative scale' what might be the threat causing doomsday to come. Then you can make up a system to measure against. In the beginning it was primarily related to atomic / nuclear risk. Today it is also taking other variables into the reflection, like climate change or disruptive technologies. This means - the symbol 'doomsday' works good enough for the projection, even more illustrated by the clock showing how near we are to that point. But the variables which might have impact on speeding up or slowing down the transition process towards a 'really bad point in reality' have to be updated. Also these relations has to be weighted in regards to the possible effects. All in all - it is not math, it is discussion. This is not weakining the validity of the statement, but the reference system is not built upon facts, but speculations. The matter of doomsday as a symbol for the ultimate problem would not change here. 

Let's now assume that it is not finally of any value that a mental model is built on math, but on a relational systems connecting root causes, effects, things we want or we deny. Then, it is more about where or how or under which conditions we want to be our kind to life in a future. If - and only if - we have empathy with all the unborn of us, then this would create a set of paradigms for our existence.

The bigger picture shall be connected to anything not only connected with us right now. The small picture shall be what works for us, but not for the guys after us. A construct like the 'Doomsday' is sort of putting most of us into the status of being innocent, as it is coming from somewhere, caused by something external. But if you take this differently into conception, then the more objective symbol would be connected to an 'us' deciding that there are no future version of 'us', right? We are never innocent or only victims as a group. As individuals, perhaps.

...

The GRID is based on the belief, that it is as has to be of importance, what each of us is doing and what we want to achieve over time.
Individuality is super great. NOT the neglection of other beings after or besides one of us. Not thinking ahead is monstrous and can be compared to ultimate war crimes related to potential effects. 

We have to improve ourselves to stay compatible to laws of the present!

#### What are the targets of the GRID? ####

The **targets of the GRID** (articulated out of a present perspective) are deeply connected to what was already introduced. To pin it down to more measurable statements, let's take a look at a list of these:

- The GRID should come up with feasible concepts for real-life problems connected to the GRID agenda items. The agenda morphs over time, but is glued to more binding values. An agenda item might be connected to a real-world problem and the agenda item 'ENERGY GENERATION' out of 'ENVIRONMENT & SUSTAINABILITY'... a problem could be connected to individual energy generation based on wind energy. Then the measurement of course would be a feasible concept and perhaps a spin-off based on a solution approach which could be valid here. So, the production of measurable output is one of the important aspects. But to get it right in the big picture - output could also be a proper art project or a theoretical concept or research outcome.
- The GRID should create uptopical drafts to balance the dystopical practice of today. Which means, that in this area it's not really to measure, if all concepts or ideas can or will be done, it is more about the creation of a vision humanity never will accomplish. It's about the thinking in possibilities, it's about images of what could be. If we are on A, what should B look like? What would be a reasonable first step towards the direction of B ... Thinking in utopical terms is a training of thinking in systems, alternatives and creation.
- The GRID will merge disciplines. There is no single truth. Reality is holistic. The merging of perspectives allows new insights. Tech-knowledge applied to art makes new brushes and vice versa. We value the inner-domain progress, but also think that it is needed to bring perspectives back into a bigger picture. That's why we do not follow one 'religion of thoughts', we make use of these concept-boxes as tools. A target here would be to let new forms of re-combination, mashups of multidisciplinary approaches emerge as regular practice.
- The GRID is an important vehicle for the projection of skills, attitudes, experiences, opinions and knowledges into a bigger picture of purposeful collaboration. BUT - the final impediment in the context of free time-usage are the needs of existence, like connected to the need for making money (so that families can exist) etc. That's why, the GRID should allow and support that gridsters use themselves to find new possibilites through collaboration. This can be the founding of a business, networking or even to work on new econonomical concepts. The time people spent should be reflected as an invest into the human society as such. We are not at the end of evolution of how one could use the lifetime.
- The GRID should always be connected to art and creative practices. 
- The GRID should always be connected to technology and science.
- The GRID should be valuable as a social environment, which is not centrally controlled.

### THE AGENDA ###

There are MAIN THEMES and SUB ITEMS ...



#### A MAIN THEME ####

... is 'a more or less everlasting topic on our radar'

- It is everlasting in a sense, that is not a weekly thing, nothing connected to daily politics, nothing which is done once a connected project succesfully was done
- Reflect a MAIN THEME as a **category of challenge** to think and act for / against
- A main theme could be 'ENVIRONMENT & SUSTAINABILITY' or 'FUTURE OF WORK'
- All main themes in sum are a collection of topics / topic areas illustrating what the GRID feels of what needs to be improved


#### SUB-ITEMS ####


... OF THE AGENDA are sub-items of MAIN THEMES.

Example: 
MAIN THEME is ENVIRONMENT & SUSTAINABILITY
- a sub item would be SUSTAINABLE FOOD (PRODUCTION)

Per sub-item we collect initiatives, papers, discussions, findings on this topic. All items therefore reflect a more actionable projection-area than the main themes above - which are perhaps more the framing foundation. 

We do not need more than these two levels of categorization.

### THE GRID VALUES ###

As the initial GRID CORE we share or accumulate certain values.
To identify a few of them let's list some thoughts ...

* We deeply believe in the value of equality and the right on individual progress
* We value life and an form of it. Mankind has to research on ways to reduce its negative impact on surrounding lifeforms, for example caused by un-/intentionally created pain, suffering, ignorance and discrimination.
* Mankind has to find ways to integrate individuality, the human collective to overcome the threat of extinction caused by itself.
* The human being is a transitional species, trapped in-between archaic past and science-fiction. To accept ourselves and transform us towards positive potential, we need to discuss utopical ideas more importantly than framing conditions.
* We value the human being as inventor, engineer, discoverer and searcher. That is one of our greatest strengths. We need to make use of this DNA in the most valuable and less desctructive way. We love technological progress, but not blind or mindless innovation.
* We know, that we know nothing. But that is good, the longer way lies ahead not behind us. We think that any ultimate answer of today is nonsense. It is legit (perhaps) within a causal row of milestones. But it cannot be ultimatively true by definition. That is why search and empathy is more important than normative answers and megalomania. The flow as a state of change is the constant we value.
* We value transparency, if it not collides with personal freedom. Personal freedom on the other side cannot be an argument to determine others in a negative way. For instance, in collision with human rights or the freedom of others. So, transparency as well as rights and the definition of freedom are doomed to be a permanent discourse. 

On the individual level we value:

* critical thinking
* openness for new thoughts and mental experiments
* creativity, playfulness and attention to the details
* the ability to value the non-functional
* the mindset needed for collaboration
* emotion, empathy and curiosity
* individuality paired with interpersonal responsibility
* flexibility towards the utopical conception of 'what could be'
* sharing among others and contribution
* the willingness to learn and develop (alone or with the group)
* the wisdom that excuses do not really matter

Explicitly, we do not think that there is a huge value in conformity or normative behaviour. But compatibility to a set of values is important, even tough each value can be challenged at any time based on arguments. The different experiences of a human beings, the conclusions and insights collected, the opinions one can have - these are important sources of information for any bigger picture related discussion. Determining the diversity does not make any sense at all, when it's about conceptual work and social reality. That's why the GRID is really open for differencies, but a minimal buy-in for the values articulated is important. 

#### GRID IMMUNE SYSTEM ####

We do not want to waste time in pseudo-discussions with racists or similar  failed souls. All in all it is nothing to invest in, it is just to prevent.

That would be a red line we draw for the GRID and within. 

Perhaps, individually a gridster would speak to a person with that badly penetrated wordview to understand deeper reasons, conditions and fears, but we would never ever accept this kind of destructive misconception as a partner for dialogue. 

That said, you can argue we are not open in an ultimate form. True. 
There will always be the deliberate difference when it comes to the point by which people (because of fear, money, power or bad education or what ever) became a virus for the collective mind. We do not want people to transmute into such a dead-end mindfuck, but if that is the case, then it is about defense. 

Finally, a virus has no other purpose than consuming others for the own sake. Perhaps it got utilized as a tactical weapon without a real own purpose. In any case, such malfunctional programming has to be isolated, fought or if still possible reprogrammed with highest attention. The GRID would act as its own immune system trying to destroy the cause for defection.

If this sound hard for you, then think again and iterate.


### GRID FRAMEWORK ###

See more details in [GRID MECHANICS](./GRIDMECHANICS.md)

The GRID FRAMEWORK explains ideas and concepts for running the GRID.

Besides infos about the GRID or the GRID MANIFSTO itself this framework will be published as food for thoughts.
We invite everyone and every social constellation to adapt, hack, modify or replicate certain concepts or the full framework for own purposes. The GRID collective will for shure see evolution, so that we will change underlying approaches or practices. Important changes will be updated. 

The GRID FRAMEWORK is influenced by different ideas and concept, like:

* beuys' idea of the social sculpture
* agility / the agile manifesto
* holacracy and other new forms of thinking organizations 
* responsive org 
* decentralization, also in the context of denentralized networks and technology approches like blockchain (conceptually at least) of course
* liquid democracy

... and many more.

Let's have a look at some of the assumptions ...

* Organizations should not affect indivudals in a way that undermines the potential of the indivudal, as this reduces the evolution / development  capabilities of the organization and the individual in a way that is not reasonable
* It is a highly valuable statement of the agile manifesto, that it is about *individuals and interactions over processes and tools* [see here](https://agilemanifesto.org/). The value of this statement would be weakened if intrerpreted to freely, like if that would understood as an argument for the statement, that any subject could easily destroy any agreed process, because it is about individuals, not processes. The people are needed to learn from what they do and based on different subjective insights and their individuality, their individual impediments and ambitions. Individuals as group should learn to adapt new processes based on how they interact. A person of a group only following own interests without any sense for consensus is not essentially useful for the group; but easily the individual perspective can be shared with the group, so that adaption can follow. Which means 'individuals' and the 'interactions' between the individuals are in the center of what consitutes the idea of a group. Processes and tools are only a concequence and nothing consitutional in that sense. This idea is very valuable.
* Agile methodologies in particular, like SCRUM or KANBAN, do not always work out (that's said based on own experience, not categorically) and for instance can easily be misused or disinterpreted, so that problems arise. SCRUM for instance, requires a lot of commitment and role-understanding of everyone involved. In practice and once real individuals come intp play, there are many pitfalls. 
* Approaches regarding incremental progress (as we know from software development for example) offer great opportunities for the stepwise adaption towards a higher validity of the outcome, can reduce 'risks' more realistically and allow more regular reflection towards value creation. They help to overcome monolithic thinking approaches which require a super hypothesis in the very beginning of a development. But there are also many pitfalls, as people tend to loose sight, if working on increments which are to narrow, etc. . The take here is, that openness towards finetuning based on granular reflection, learning based on the outcome of steps / increments (not based on the whole route) and the breaking down of invests (like in time) towards the achievement of mini-milestones ... all of this makes perfect sense as a practical way to do things. Once this idea is internalized, it can be applied to many aspects in reality. For example, of how democratic practices could be brought into a next level.
*  The idea of decentral organization of *constructs* is perhaps only possible after ideas of system theory (take Luhmann or autopoietic theories) and a bit of complexity theory. If the connection was done deliberately or not, the whole idea of how technical (remember the early cybernetic systems described) or social system has to be broken down in subsystems, environements etc. can also be found again in newer thoughts on decentral organization. And perhaps this is not even surprsising as, during our last centuries, we widened and deepened our observation on a macro and micro scale. For instance in astrophysics, biology, quantum theory or when trying to just forecast weather. What influenced the idea of the grid is, that the decentral organization of a 'construct' or organism would be the most robust and flexible one paired, plus, the decentral idea of this concstruct would be more robust against misusage or inflexibility of the construct. Sub-grids are an example which could be easily compared with sub-systems. The overall system is only a mental model for it's part. And the same goes for a sub-system. The atomic scale would be an individual, an idea, a concept. This all intentionally contradicts the idea of central determination of an organism, which still is the typical 'top-down' or hierarchical form of how most social systems and organizations are designed. This means that the GRID design tries to follow the principle of decentrality and bottom-up organization, but enriches this which the additional (and more pragmatical) idea of a CORE GROUP and functions. The purpose behind these constructs is the idea of maintenance, service, aggregation and community management. So both constructs, CORE GROUP and functions, should be interpreted as inner service functions to maintain the interaction between sub-systems, towards agenda building, consensus building or onboarding of new gridsters. 
* Liquid democracy was also mentioned as one of the influencial concepts. In the first version of the GRID we soon identified the problem of low participation for the decision making process. In other words, it is very important for an organism to be actionable towards the own ambitions. If for example the lack of participation would provoke a situation by which votings cannot be done or consensus cannot be created, then the organims cannot move and loses its potential impact and purpose. Because of this there has to be a way to define a current state of mind which will be sufficient to make a decision, like towards a shared initiative or important agenda decisions. There are different ways to design such ways to create a minimal viable consensus, so that the needed pace is possible based on the interaction design.


This hopefully gave some insights on which ideas influenced the GRID methodologies. The overall package of these concepts will be called GRID MECHANICS or as a bundle of concepts GRID FRAMEWORK.

If you want to share your additional findings, ideas or feedback to improve the [GRID MECHANICS](./GRIDMECHANICS.md), please feel free to reach out to 

[gridcore@into-the-grid.org](mailto:gridcore@into-the-grid.org)

Due to the mindset of adaption and openness towards change, and to not let processes determine individuals and their interactions, the GRID MECHANICS have been changed and will change. Significant updates will be posted.
