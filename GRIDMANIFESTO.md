# GRID MANIFESTO #


### THE GRID, WHY ###


### THE GRID VALUES ###

As the initial GRID CORE we share or accumulate certain values.
To identify a few of them let's list some thoughts ...

* We deeply believe in the value of equality and the right on individual progress
* Mankind has to research on ways to reduce its negative impact on surrounding lifeforms, for example caused by un-/intentionally created pain, suffering, ignorance and discrimination.
* Mankind has to find ways to integrate individuality, the human collective to overcome the threat of extinction.
* The human being is a transitional species, trapped in-between archaic past and science-fiction. To accept ourselves and transform us towards positive potential, we need to discuss utopical ideas more importantly than framing conditions.

Supported behaviour

* critical thinking and challenging discussion
* creativity and experimentation
* the value of non-functionality
* collaboration and constuctivity
* individuality and collective repsonsibility
* utopical conception of 'what can be'
* sharing among others and contribution


### GRID FRAMEWORK and GRID MECHANICS ###

The GRID FRAMEWORK is influenced by different ideas and concept, like:

* beuys' idea of the social sculpture
* agility / the agile manifesto
* holacracy and other new forms of thinking organizations 
* responsive org 
* decentralization, also in the context of technology of course
* liquid democracy

... and many more.

The GRID FRAMEWORK consists of some core assets articulated as GRID MECHANICS:

 * BOGI (BATTLE OF GLORIOUS IDEAS)
