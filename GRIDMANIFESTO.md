# GRID MANIFESTO #


### AN INTRODUCTION TO THE GRID ###

The GRID got ramped-up in May 2018.

An early ambition for a concept like the GRID was to form a decentralized organized network of individuals to make things happen. Individuals of any color, sex, religion or social background ..., but compatible enough to form a platform for new chances and higher impact.

Chances for the creation of cultural assets as well as chances for bringing together the right people at the right time to form new initiatives.

As articulated in the film Fight Club ... 

	'You are not your job.
	You are not how much money you have in the bank.
	You are not the shoes you wear.
	You are not the contents of your wallet.'

... the fundamental motivation behind the GRID is to start an experiment liberating individual and group potential. A potential, not driven by money, not regulated by power, but intrisic motivation. A potential which could be focused furthermore for doing good stuff with higher positive impact for the individual being and collective journey.

The GRID'S ambition level on a more abstract level is to form a workforce dedicated to the challenge of thinking in better versions of the world. 

And we think, that it is on each of us to improve many aspects of our world:

####*//side-intro*####

Let's say ... the world is not totally fucked-up, but ...

... many of the latest global political trends, caused by reactionary, populist or even autocratic misconception and degration of reality require immediate and long-term action. As humanity we have to become better version of ourselves, not the contrary. We are not consumers, not slaves, not ressources for anyone else - we are the difference when it comes to future. 

Our world is n-dimensionally connected and physically limited when it comes earths ressources we feast on or the air we breathe. Only the increase of collective wisdom, foresight, empathie and collaboration will save us. We need to increase the civilisatoric evolutionspeed. We need a vision of ourselve. Not anything like the law of the jungle, more walls, suppression, protectionism or any other prehistoric behavioural pattern. We have to invest into a global sociocultural progress, we do not must go back into trees or holes, throwing stones at each other. 

More than that, humanity has to face many major challenges, for example caused by the effect of climate change and our global impact connected the immoral exploitation of natural ressources (including other species). We must grow up and find ways to re-think what we do and how we do it. Not corporates will save, not any of our gods, and for sure - none of the reactionary leaders. It's not about democracy here - it is about future models and concepts of how we could live, of what we want to achieve, of how we can define and reach a  healthy global prosperity level open for all, equality of chances and rights, global do's and dont's and balanced behaviour with our surrounding environment and other life.

Even more than that, we have to answer so many detailed ethical, pragmatical or existentially important questions within a highly complex world. We haven't overcome fundamental problems, like warfare, discrimination and other hygiene factors compared to what it takes looking into future. We are absolutely not sure what robotics, AI, automation, nano- and biotech and other disruptive technologies will finally mean to our shared existence. Economy at this stage is also just forming new empires, not a better world, if we think about the increased gap between super-rich and poor individuals.

There were a lot of good evolutions going on during the last thousands of years. But what needs attention is the shit. So the lines before shall not express cultural pessimism at its best - on the contrary, it is articulated out of the ambition and strong belief that we can achieve a lot of more crazy things if we only try it and do not lay back. Plus, it is not the time to lay back, since some of the achievements for which many souls fought over centuries can get lost again. We have to pay attention to the big picture and the detail. That is the mission without alternative.

####*//side-intro end*####

The GRID is and will not be an answer to the big question of this centruy. 

(Promise!)

But it tries to identify valid questions on a high and low level. 

It is just meant as a small brick on the road which needs to be paved, not the road itself. The GRID is intended to perhaps become a social plastic, a think tank, a decentral collaboration collective, a room for reflection, analysis and debate.

*Nothing more.*

*And nothing less.*

**This all starts with people.** People, who show buy-in and are willing to share lots and lots of hours of discussion, exchanging hypotheses and chatting.
People who try and fail - endless times perhaps. 


The GRID is not a promise, it's an unproven experiment.

The GRID is not a political party, it's just people.

The GRID is not a secret organization, it's an environment of collaborators.

The GRID is not a commercial project, it's a social plastic.

The GRID has no investors, it is just there ...

#### What are the targets of the GRID? ####

The **targets of the GRID** (articulated out of a present perspective) are deeply connected to what was already introduced. To pin it down to more measurable statements, let's take a look at a list of these:

- The GRID should come up with feasible concepts for real-life problems connected to the GRID agenda items. The agenda morphs over time, but is glued to more binding values. An agenda item might be connected to a real-world problem and the agenda item 'ENERGY GENERATION' out of 'ENVIRONMENT & SUSTAINABILITY'... a problem could be connected to individual energy generation based on wind energy. Then the measurement of course would be a feasible concept and perhaps a spin-off based on a solution approach which could be valid here. So, the production of measurable output is one of the important aspects. But to get it right in the big picture - output could also be a proper art project or a theoretical concept or research outcome.
- The GRID should create uptopical drafts to balance the dystopical practice of today. Which means, that in this area it's not really to measure, if all concepts or ideas can or will be done, it is more about the creation of a vision humanity never will accomplish. It's about the thinking in possibilities, it's about images of what could be. If we are on A, what should B look like? What would be a reasonable first step towards the direction of B ... Thinking in utopical terms is a training of thinking in systems, alternatives and creation.
- The GRID will merge disciplines. There is no single truth. Reality is holistic. The merging of perspectives allows new insights. Tech-knowledge applied to art makes new brushes and vice versa. We value the inner-domain progress, but also think that it is needed to bring perspectives back into a bigger picture. That's why we do not follow one 'religion of thoughts', we make use of these concept-boxes as tools. A target here would be to let new forms of re-combination, mashups of multidisciplinary approaches emerge as regular practice.
- The GRID is an important vehicle for the projection of skills, attitudes, experiences, opinions and knowledges into a bigger picture of purposeful collaboration. BUT - the final impediment in the context of free time-usage are the needs of existence, like connected to the need for making money (so that families can exist) etc. That's why, the GRID should allow and support that gridsters use themselves to find new possibilites through collaboration. This can be the founding of a business, networking or even to work on new econonomical concepts. The time people spent should be reflected as an invest into the human society as such. We are not at the end of evolution of how one could use the lifetime.
- The GRID should always be connected to art and creative practices. 
- The GRID should always be connected to technology and science.
- The GRID should be valuable as a social environment, which is not centrally controlled.

#### GRID development phases ####

As the GRID is in its ramp-up phase it would not be appropriate to speak in only bold words and say that most work is done. On the contrary, building a sustainable foundation for the GRID is a challenge, full of questionmarks and can fail every day. 

Therefore, the initial milestone is the establishment of the GRID existence as such. And again, there are tons of impediments and challenges to pass, so that the GRID will emerge out of nothing.

We divided up these three phases:

1) **Ramp-Up**: establish a formal shape of how we work and discuss the agenda and values in more details. In parallel let's experiment with the challenges within an initial core group, to later start with better practices and provide some more answers. This phase is the most critical one, since the number of people is small, so that there is no critical mass to sustain traction and flow. At any point in time this phase can fail due to lack of participation etc. That's because the number of people is not granting motivational offering for each individual in a way that it feels the movement. This phase would be a hard check of survival chances for the GRID.

2) **Roll-Out**: once the first phase would be passed, we defined that the roll-out in doses would be important to naturally grow and sustain the needed social integration step-by-step. With the second phase also tooling, time arrangements (like video meetings etc.) needs to scale up according to the increased number of gridsters. The same goes for interaction methodologies, like votings, orga, aso. So the second phase is connected to a lot of pragmatical challenges connected to the roll-out. Secondly, this phase shall be self-sustaining in regards to the traction on initiatives, experiments, agenda discussions or finally outcome. That's why it becomes important to push the focus on action items more compared to a more theoretical 'founding' 
phase ...

3) **Scale-Out**: in this phase a critical size would be exceeded (self-sustaining-wise) and the first challenges are taken. Now it's about scalability in methodology and decentralized organization. At this points we should have learned how to deal with trolls, failure and growth. We should have learned which GRID-functions work out, which not and how to adapt the overall practices to sustain the GRID in a flexible way and also to stay lean. At this point perhaps the GRID is a different contruct in itself, because new needs had to be answered, like the need to have a source for funding GRID ideas. That's why, it is not a target today to determine the final format or details if the consistency to values stays in line. 

____________



#### The GRID shall become a *mashup of the following* ####

* A decentralized environment allowing people to connect and collaborate
* A laboratory and think-tank
* A place for researching on new ways of participation
* A clear statement against reactionary, populist, fashist or racist tendencies and other forms of fatal misconception
* A network of individuals sharing the general belief that lifetime could be better spent (and abilities could utilized and developed more purposeful) than in monolithic job-constructs
* A non-commercial collective which supports the formation of commercial spin-offs (comment: monetarization of own work and ideas is not bad, if a resulting organization is willing to commit to moral and sustainability standards) as well as other initiatives (like cultural or social projects)
* An interdisciplinary room where art, technology, critical thinking and research are not antagonists at all, but domains of multidisciplinary stimulation
* A concept in which innovation, invention and ideation is understood as a cultural methodology to overcome problems - nothing more (!)
* A place where the creation of cultural, technological or commercial assets is reflected as natural human behaviour
* A call for utopical concepts and promising ideas related to the human future (as individual being and the human society)
* An assembly of tools, skills, experiences, methodologies and approaches to make use of
* A vehicle to create an agenda of relevant future questions (GRID AGENDA), which are main themes of action like an umbrella - this implicitly questions perhaps the agenda setting
* A foundation for interaction based on values
* A conceptual framework (GRID MECHANICS) which can be replicated, hacked, adopted for other purposes - that's why we share it
* An impact creating organism - the GRID has to measure itself on its output to survive furthermore > too low output will lead to new increments or death
* Fun & passion as it is a social endeavor
* Experimental space for functional and non-functional ideas
* A place to make use of your skills and individuality through contribution
* A place to find the right people for the realization of your idea
* A room for learning and exchange of expertise
* A mental model which purely is driven and sustained by intrinsic motivation

[...]



#### The *GRID is not* ####

* A place for trolling, bullying or any kind of discrimination
* A place for racists, fashists, homophobics
* A company or any other form of commercial undertaking
* A place for one-directional consume of benefits / misuse of people skills (meaning: if one wants to get something out, one needs to bring something in)
* Disconnected from existing laws and restrictions
* Written in stone related to its conception, processes or methodology, as it is meant to be a learning, flexible and adaptive organism
* Meant to be an answer (instead it is meant to be a place for better questions)
* A special interest group, because of its interdisciplinary approach
* For granted - forming, maintaining, sustaining the GRID and it's evolution is hard work. There is always the risk for ultimate failure - and that is ok.
* A binding show! Once you became GRIDSTER, there is no binding form or frequence of contribution. But obviously the chances are low to create high impact without participation or contribution. But it's not anyhow connected to binding mechanisms.

### THE AGENDA ###

There are MAIN THEMES and SUB ITEMS ...

#### A MAIN THEME ####

... is 'a more or less everlasting topic on our radar'

- It is everlasting in a sense, that is not a weekly thing, nothing connected to daily politics, nothing which is done once a connected project succesfully was done
- Reflect a MAIN THEME as a **category of challenge** to think and act for / against
- A main theme could be 'ENVIRONMENT & SUSTAINABILITY' or 'FUTURE OF WORK'
- All main themes in sum are a collection of topics / topic areas illustrating what the GRID feels of what needs to be improved


#### SUB-ITEMS #### 

... OF THE AGENDA are sub-items of MAIN THEMES.

Example: 
MAIN THEME is ENVIRONMENT & SUSTAINABILITY
- a sub item would be SUSTAINABLE FOOD (PRODUCTION)

Per sub-item we collect initiatives, papers, discussions, findings on this topic. All items therefore reflect a more actionable projection-area than the main themes above - which are perhaps more the framing foundation. 

We do not need more than these two levels of categorization.

### THE GRID VALUES ###

As the initial GRID CORE we share or accumulate certain values.
To identify a few of them let's list some thoughts ...

* We deeply believe in the value of equality and the right on individual progress
* Mankind has to research on ways to reduce its negative impact on surrounding lifeforms, for example caused by un-/intentionally created pain, suffering, ignorance and discrimination.
* Mankind has to find ways to integrate individuality, the human collective to overcome the threat of extinction.
* The human being is a transitional species, trapped in-between archaic past and science-fiction. To accept ourselves and transform us towards positive potential, we need to discuss utopical ideas more importantly than framing conditions.

Behaviour and attitudes we welcome:

* critical challenging thinking
* openness for exchange of thoughts
* creativity and experimentation
* the value of non-functionality
* collaboration and constuctivity
* individuality and collective repsonsibility
* utopical conception of 'what can be'
* sharing among others and contribution
* curiosity and the willingness to learn


### GRID FRAMEWORK ###

The GRID FRAMEWORK explains ideas and concepts for running the GRID.

Besides infos about the GRID or the GRID MANIFSTO itself this framework will be published as food for thoughts.
We invite everyone and every social constellation to adapt, hack, modify or replicate certain concepts or the full framework for own purposes. The GRID collective will for shure see evolution, so that we will change underlying approaches or practices. Important changes will be updated. 

If you want to share your findings, ideas or feedback, please reach out to
