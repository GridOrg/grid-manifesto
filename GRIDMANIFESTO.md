# GRID MANIFESTO #


### AN INTRODUCTION TO THE GRID ###

The GRID got ramped-up in May 2018.

The early ambition was to trigger the existence of a decentralized network of individuals. 
Individuals of any color, sex, religion ..., but compatible enough to form a platform for new chances.

Chances for the creation of cultural assets as well as chances for bringing together the right people at the right time.
As articulated in the film Fight Club ... 

	'You are not your job.
	You are not how much money you have in the bank.
	You are not the shoes you wear.
	You are not the contents of your wallet.'

... the very initial motivation behind the GRID is to start a journey and work for the liberation of individual and group potential. A potential, not driven by money or power, but the pure will to create a workforce for building better versions of the world. And we have to improve our world furthermore - there is no alternative:

The world is not totally fucked-up, but many of the latest political trends towards reactionary, populist or even autocratic misconception of reality require action. More than that, humanity has to face many major challenges caused by climate change and our global impact connected the immoral exploitation of natural ressources and other species. Even more than that, we have to answer so many ethical, pragmatical or existentially questions in an increasingly complex world. We haven't overcome inequality, wars, discrimination and many other roadblocks on our way to future. We are not sure what robotics, AI, automation, nano- and biotech and other disruptive technologies will finally mean to or within our existence. 

The GRID is just meant as a brick on the road to be paved. Nothing more.

And this all starts with people. People, which show buy-in and share lots and lots of hours of discussion, exchange of hypotheses and people who try and fail and try and ... . 
Still, the main theme of the GRID shall be to free ourselves from determining factors to become better versions of it.
With the targets of interpersonal and social contribution, the exchange and action on ideas.

____________

The GRID shall be a *mashup of the following*:

* A decentralized environment allowing people to connect and collaborate
* A laboratory and think-tank
* A place where to create ways of participation
* A statement against reactionary tendencies or other forms of fatal misconception
* A network of individuals sharing the general belief that lifetime could be better spent (and abilities could utilized and developed more purposeful) than in monolithic job-constructs
* A non-commercial collective which supports the formation of commercial spin-offs (comment: monetarization of own work and ideas is not bad, if a resulting organization is willing to commit to moral and sustainability standards) as well as other initiatives (like cultural or social projects)
* A interdisciplinary room where art, technology, critical thinking or research are not antagonists at all, but domains of stimulation for each other
* A concept in which innovation, invention and ideation is understood as a cultural methodology to overcome problems - nothing more (!)
* A place where the creation of cultural, technological or commercial assets is reflected as natural human behaviour
* A call for utopical concepts and promising ideas related to the human future
* An assembly of tools, skills, experiences, methodologies and approaches to make use of
* A vehicle to create an agenda of relevant future questions (GRID AGENDA), which are main themes of action like an umbrella
* A foundation of values
* A conceptual framework (GRID MECHANICS) which can be replicated, hacked, adopted for other purposes
* An impact creating organism - the GRID has to measure itself on its output to survive
* Fun & passion
* Experimental space
* Social sculpture
* A place to use your skills and individuality
* A place where it is possible to find the right people for the realization of your idea
* A room for learing and exchange
* A mental model which only is driven and sustained by intrinsic motivation.

[...]

The *GRID is not*:

* A place for trolling, bullying or any kind of discrimination
* A place for racists, reactionsts, populists, fashists, homophobics
* A company or any other form of commercial undertaking
* A place for one-directional consume of benefits / misuse of people skills (meaning: if one wants to get something out, one needs to bring something in)
* Disconnected from existing laws and restrictions
* Written in stone related to its conception, processes or methodology, as it is meant to be a learning, flexible and adaptive organism
* Meant to be an answer (instead it is meant to be a place for better questions)
* A special interest group, because of its interdisciplinary approach
* For granted - forming, maintaining, sustaining the GRID and it's evolution is hard work. There is always the risk for ultimate failure - and that is ok.
* A binding show! Once you became GRIDSTER, there is no binding form or frequence of contribution. But obviously the chances are low to create high impact without participation or contribution. But it's not anyhow connected to binding mechanisms.


### THE GRID VALUES ###

As the initial GRID CORE we share or accumulate certain values.
To identify a few of them let's list some thoughts ...

* We deeply believe in the value of equality and the right on individual progress
* Mankind has to research on ways to reduce its negative impact on surrounding lifeforms, for example caused by un-/intentionally created pain, suffering, ignorance and discrimination.
* Mankind has to find ways to integrate individuality, the human collective to overcome the threat of extinction.
* The human being is a transitional species, trapped in-between archaic past and science-fiction. To accept ourselves and transform us towards positive potential, we need to discuss utopical ideas more importantly than framing conditions.

Supported behaviour

* critical thinking and challenging discussion
* creativity and experimentation
* the value of non-functionality
* collaboration and constuctivity
* individuality and collective repsonsibility
* utopical conception of 'what can be'
* sharing among others and contribution
* curiosity and the willingness to learn





### What is the grid? ###

* A heterogene mix of interests and topics
* A decentral and open construct, only restricted by its values
