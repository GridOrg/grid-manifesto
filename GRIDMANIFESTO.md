# GRID MANIFESTO #



#### What are some beliefs to get the picture ? ####

The mental model of the world has to shift into some big picture attitude.
Let's do a short experiment of thoughts... 

If you project the human species in a point in time contradicting the present status quo. What are possible thoughts in here?

It is not that spectacular to think humanity without nations.
It would not be extremely surprising that - in 1-2 thousands of years - we had to find ways to change our paradigms for energy production, for food production, for the search and mining and consumption of ressources, for the definition of work, for what a religion is, for technology we have to develop based on future challenges. 

What do you think?

What is a minimal viable reality in a thousand years?

To be not the ultimate looser in a thousand years, what would be the consequence projected back into our present reality?

Which parameters should be taken into the calculation here?

Some aspects are rather simple:

We will have problems with ressources sooner or later. If you extrapolate the growth rate of our species for a century (like a weather forecast let's say) and if you add the ressource consumption of today into this calculation, then you don't have to be a genius to come to the conclusion that there might be a problem one day. How do we normally act in such situations (use history books here)? Hmmm ... pretty uncool, right? Which alternative realities could be provoked then, if we change variables in the near future? Which variables do we put to discussions, which are not to discuss? Then what will result?

Some aspects are rather complicated:

Like the *Club of rome* had some errors in extrapolation, most people will have errors in extrapolation towards a bigger picture. Because bigger pictures never are free from intention, because you always miss the unpredictable variable, because we are only smart in reviews. That's perhaps our cognitive condition. But the bigger picture is not really about the accurate calculation, it is about the interpretation which adaption needs to be done, if this or that outcome shall be the preferred one. Compare this to the doomsday clock ...  [(check it out here)](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/) Most of us think, doomsday is rather uncool - let's not have it. That's why we measure 'somehow on a qualitative scale' what might be the threat causing doomsday to come. Then you can make up a system to measure against. In the beginning it was primarily related to atomic / nuclear risk. Today it is also taking other variables into the reflection, like climate change or disruptive technologies. This means - the symbol 'doomsday' works good enough for the projection, even more illustrated by the clock showing how near we are to that point. But the variables which might have impact on speeding up or slowing down the transition process towards a 'really bad point in reality' have to be updated. Also these relations has to be weighted in regards to the possible effects. All in all - it is not math, it is discussion. This is not weakining the validity of the statement, but the reference system is not built upon facts, but speculations. The matter of doomsday as a symbol for the ultimate problem would not change here. 

Let's now assume that it is not finally of any value that a mental model is built on math, but on a relational systems connecting root causes, effects, things we want or we deny. Then, it is more about where or how or under which conditions we want to be our kind to life in a future. If - and only if - we have empathy with all the unborn of us, then this would create a set of paradigms for our existence.

The bigger picture shall be connected to anything not only connected with us right now. The small picture shall be what works for us, but not for the guys after us. A construct like the 'Doomsday' is sort of putting most of us into the status of being innocent, as it is coming from somewhere, caused by something external. But if you take this differently into conception, then the more objective symbol would be connected to an 'us' deciding that there are no future version of 'us', right? We are never innocent or only victims as a group. As individuals, perhaps.

...

The GRID is based on the belief, that it is as has to be of importance, what each of us is doing and what we want to achieve over time.
Individuality is super great. NOT the neglection of other beings after or besides one of us. Not thinking ahead is monstrous and can be compared to ultimate war crimes related to potential effects. 

We have to improve ourselves to stay compatible to laws of the present!

#### What are the targets of the GRID? ####

The **targets of the GRID** (articulated out of a present perspective) are deeply connected to what was already introduced. To pin it down to more measurable statements, let's take a look at a list of these:

- The GRID should come up with feasible concepts for real-life problems connected to the GRID agenda items. The agenda morphs over time, but is glued to more binding values. An agenda item might be connected to a real-world problem and the agenda item 'ENERGY GENERATION' out of 'ENVIRONMENT & SUSTAINABILITY'... a problem could be connected to individual energy generation based on wind energy. Then the measurement of course would be a feasible concept and perhaps a spin-off based on a solution approach which could be valid here. So, the production of measurable output is one of the important aspects. But to get it right in the big picture - output could also be a proper art project or a theoretical concept or research outcome.
- The GRID should create uptopical drafts to balance the dystopical practice of today. Which means, that in this area it's not really to measure, if all concepts or ideas can or will be done, it is more about the creation of a vision humanity never will accomplish. It's about the thinking in possibilities, it's about images of what could be. If we are on A, what should B look like? What would be a reasonable first step towards the direction of B ... Thinking in utopical terms is a training of thinking in systems, alternatives and creation.
- The GRID will merge disciplines. There is no single truth. Reality is holistic. The merging of perspectives allows new insights. Tech-knowledge applied to art makes new brushes and vice versa. We value the inner-domain progress, but also think that it is needed to bring perspectives back into a bigger picture. That's why we do not follow one 'religion of thoughts', we make use of these concept-boxes as tools. A target here would be to let new forms of re-combination, mashups of multidisciplinary approaches emerge as regular practice.
- The GRID is an important vehicle for the projection of skills, attitudes, experiences, opinions and knowledges into a bigger picture of purposeful collaboration. BUT - the final impediment in the context of free time-usage are the needs of existence, like connected to the need for making money (so that families can exist) etc. That's why, the GRID should allow and support that gridsters use themselves to find new possibilites through collaboration. This can be the founding of a business, networking or even to work on new econonomical concepts. The time people spent should be reflected as an invest into the human society as such. We are not at the end of evolution of how one could use the lifetime.
- The GRID should always be connected to art and creative practices. 
- The GRID should always be connected to technology and science.
- The GRID should be valuable as a social environment, which is not centrally controlled.

### THE GRID VALUES ###

As the initial GRID CORE we share or accumulate certain values.
To identify a few of them let's list some thoughts ...

* We deeply believe in the value of equality and the right on individual progress
* We value life and an form of it. Mankind has to research on ways to reduce its negative impact on surrounding lifeforms, for example caused by un-/intentionally created pain, suffering, ignorance and discrimination.
* Mankind has to find ways to integrate individuality, the human collective to overcome the threat of extinction caused by itself.
* The human being is a transitional species, trapped in-between archaic past and science-fiction. To accept ourselves and transform us towards positive potential, we need to discuss utopical ideas more importantly than framing conditions.
* We value the human being as inventor, engineer, discoverer and searcher. That is one of our greatest strengths. We need to make use of this DNA in the most valuable and less desctructive way. We love technological progress, but not blind or mindless innovation.
* We know, that we know nothing. But that is good, the longer way lies ahead not behind us. We think that any ultimate answer of today is nonsense. It is legit (perhaps) within a causal row of milestones. But it cannot be ultimatively true by definition. That is why search and empathy is more important than normative answers and megalomania. The flow as a state of change is the constant we value.
* We value transparency, if it not collides with personal freedom. Personal freedom on the other side cannot be an argument to determine others in a negative way. For instance, in collision with human rights or the freedom of others. So, transparency as well as rights and the definition of freedom are doomed to be a permanent discourse. 

On the individual level we value:

* critical thinking
* openness for new thoughts and mental experiments
* creativity, playfulness and attention to the details
* the ability to value the non-functional
* the mindset needed for collaboration
* emotion, empathy and curiosity
* individuality paired with interpersonal responsibility
* flexibility towards the utopical conception of 'what could be'
* sharing among others and contribution
* the willingness to learn and develop (alone or with the group)
* the wisdom that excuses do not really matter


Explicitly, we do not think that there is a huge value in conformity or normative behaviour. But compatibility to a set of values is important, even tough each value can be challenged at any time based on arguments. The different experiences of a human beings, the conclusions and insights collected, the opinions one can have - these are important sources of information for any bigger picture related discussion. Determining the diversity does not make any sense at all, when it's about conceptual work and social reality. That's why the GRID is really open for differencies, but a minimal buy-in for the values articulated is important.
