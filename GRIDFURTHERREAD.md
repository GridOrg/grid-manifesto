### GRID - further information and context ###




#### GRID development phases ####

As the GRID is in its ramp-up phase it would not be appropriate to speak in only bold words and say that most work is done. On the contrary, building a sustainable foundation for the GRID is a challenge, full of questionmarks and can fail every day. 

Therefore, the initial milestone is the establishment of the GRID existence as such. And again, there are tons of impediments and challenges to pass, so that the GRID will emerge out of nothing.

We divided up these three phases:

1) **Ramp-Up**: establish a formal shape of how we work and discuss the agenda and values in more details. In parallel let's experiment with the challenges within an initial core group, to later start with better practices and provide some more answers. This phase is the most critical one, since the number of people is small, so that there is no critical mass to sustain traction and flow. At any point in time this phase can fail due to lack of participation etc. That's because the number of people is not granting motivational offering for each individual in a way that it feels the movement. This phase would be a hard check of survival chances for the GRID.

2) **Roll-Out**: once the first phase would be passed, we defined that the roll-out in doses would be important to naturally grow and sustain the needed social integration step-by-step. With the second phase also tooling, time arrangements (like video meetings etc.) needs to scale up according to the increased number of gridsters. The same goes for interaction methodologies, like votings, orga, aso. So the second phase is connected to a lot of pragmatical challenges connected to the roll-out. Secondly, this phase shall be self-sustaining in regards to the traction on initiatives, experiments, agenda discussions or finally outcome. That's why it becomes important to push the focus on action items more compared to a more theoretical 'founding' 
phase ...

3) **Scale-Out**: in this phase a critical size would be exceeded (self-sustaining-wise) and the first challenges are taken. Now it's about scalability in methodology and decentralized organization. At this points we should have learned how to deal with trolls, failure and growth. We should have learned which GRID-functions work out, which not and how to adapt the overall practices to sustain the GRID in a flexible way and also to stay lean. At this point perhaps the GRID is a different contruct in itself, because new needs had to be answered, like the need to have a source for funding GRID ideas. That's why, it is not a target today to determine the final format or details if the consistency to values stays in line.

#### The GRID shall become a *mashup of the following* ####

* A decentralized environment allowing people to connect and collaborate
* A laboratory and think-tank
* A place for researching on new ways of participation
* A clear statement against reactionary, populist, fashist or racist tendencies and other forms of fatal misconception
* A network of individuals sharing the general belief that lifetime could be better spent (and abilities could utilized and developed more purposeful) than in monolithic job-constructs
* A non-commercial collective which supports the formation of commercial spin-offs (comment: monetarization of own work and ideas is not bad, if a resulting organization is willing to commit to moral and sustainability standards) as well as other initiatives (like cultural or social projects)
* An interdisciplinary room where art, technology, critical thinking and research are not antagonists at all, but domains of multidisciplinary stimulation
* A concept in which innovation, invention and ideation is understood as a cultural methodology to overcome problems - nothing more (!)
* A place where the creation of cultural, technological or commercial assets is reflected as natural human behaviour
* A call for utopical concepts and promising ideas related to the human future (as individual being and the human society)
* An assembly of tools, skills, experiences, methodologies and approaches to make use of
* A vehicle to create an agenda of relevant future questions (GRID AGENDA), which are main themes of action like an umbrella - this implicitly questions perhaps the agenda setting
* A foundation for interaction based on values
* A conceptual framework (GRID MECHANICS) which can be replicated, hacked, adopted for other purposes - that's why we share it
* An impact creating organism - the GRID has to measure itself on its output to survive furthermore > too low output will lead to new increments or death
* Fun & passion as it is a social endeavor
* Experimental space for functional and non-functional ideas
* A place to make use of your skills and individuality through contribution
* A place to find the right people for the realization of your idea
* A room for learning and exchange of expertise
* A mental model which purely is driven and sustained by intrinsic motivation

[...]



#### The *GRID is not* ####

* A place for trolling, bullying or any kind of discrimination
* A place for racists, fashists, homophobics
* A company or any other form of commercial undertaking
* A place for one-directional consume of benefits / misuse of people skills (meaning: if one wants to get something out, one needs to bring something in)
* Disconnected from existing laws and restrictions
* Written in stone related to its conception, processes or methodology, as it is meant to be a learning, flexible and adaptive organism
* Meant to be an answer (instead it is meant to be a place for better questions)
* A special interest group, because of its interdisciplinary approach
* For granted - forming, maintaining, sustaining the GRID and it's evolution is hard work. There is always the risk for ultimate failure - and that is ok.
* A binding show! Once you became GRIDSTER, there is no binding form or frequence of contribution. But obviously the chances are low to create high impact without participation or contribution. But it's not anyhow connected to binding mechanisms.

#### GRID IMMUNE SYSTEM ####

We do not want to waste time in pseudo-discussions with racists or similar  failed souls. All in all it is nothing to invest in, it is just to prevent.

That would be a red line we draw for the GRID and within. 

Perhaps, individually a gridster would speak to a person with that badly penetrated wordview to understand deeper reasons, conditions and fears, but we would never ever accept this kind of destructive misconception as a partner for dialogue. 

That said, you can argue we are not open in an ultimate form. True. 
There will always be the deliberate difference when it comes to the point by which people (because of fear, money, power or bad education or what ever) became a virus for the collective mind. We do not want people to transmute into such a dead-end mindfuck, but if that is the case, then it is about defense. 

Finally, a virus has no other purpose than consuming others for the own sake. Perhaps it got utilized as a tactical weapon without a real own purpose. In any case, such malfunctional programming has to be isolated, fought or if still possible reprogrammed with highest attention. The GRID would act as its own immune system trying to destroy the cause for defection.

If this sound hard for you, then think again and iterate.
